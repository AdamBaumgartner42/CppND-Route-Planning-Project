TODO 4:
Complete the AddNeighboors method to expand the current node by adding all unvisited neighboors to the open list. 

Tips: 
*1*Use the FindNeighboors() method of the current_node to populate current_node.neighboors vector with all the neighboors. 


void FindNeighbors();

// Confusing b/c this is void method. 
// What is it updating. Probably a memory location.

current_node.FindNeighboors();

Q: Does it add them to the "Open List"?
Q: What is the Open List?
route_planner.h
-> open_list 


*2* For each node in current_node.neighboors, set the parent, the h value and the g value

Q: Is this a vector of a data type which holds 1.parent, 2.h_value, 3.g_value
A: Vector of type Node, 1,2,3 are all public variables
